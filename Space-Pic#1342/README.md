NASA APOD Image Display
This project provides a Python script to retrieve and display the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).

Contribution: Fix/Enhancement Details
This repository is being actively developed for Hacktoberfest. The latest update addresses the following:

Issue Solved: Ensures the correct image is retrieved for the current date by explicitly passing the YYYY-MM-DD format to the NASA API, preventing the script from defaulting to a cached or older image.

Enhancement: The date from the API response is now set as the bold plot title for clear identification.

This is for the Hacktober Fest 2025.
