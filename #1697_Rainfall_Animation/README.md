# Rainfall Animation

This Python script creates a simple rainfall animation using the `pygame` library.
It simulates raindrops falling uniformly with splash effects and a dark background for a night-rain atmosphere.

## How It Works

Each raindrop is represented as an object that falls at a uniform speed.
When a drop reaches the ground, it resets and creates a small splash effect.
The animation updates continuously to create the appearance of moving rain.

### Running the Script

To run the animation, execute the Python file:

```bash
python rainfall_effect.py
```
This will open a new window showing the falling raindrops in motion.
Use the close button or press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the program.
