# 🔢 Prime Visualizer: Ulam Spiral

This Python script visualizes prime numbers in a spiral pattern known as the **Ulam Spiral**. It reveals surprising diagonal structures and patterns in the distribution of primes.

## 📌 Features
- Generates a square spiral of numbers
- Highlights prime numbers as dots
- Uses `matplotlib` for visualization
- Fully self-contained in one file

## 🧠 How It Works
- Numbers are arranged in a spiral starting from the center.
- Prime numbers are plotted as blue dots.
- The result is a visual pattern where primes often align along diagonal lines.

## ▶️ Run the Script

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib` and `numpy` (install via pip)

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
python prime_visualizer.py
