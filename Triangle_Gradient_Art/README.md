\# Triangle Gradient Art ðŸŽ¨



This project generates colorful, semi-transparent triangles layered randomly across a canvas; creating abstract, gradient-like art.



\## Requirements



* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Google Colab (optional, for easy display)
* Install the dependencies:
  pip install opencv-python numpy



\## How to Run



* Copy the code into a .py file or a Colab notebook.
* Run the script â€” it will randomly generate a unique piece of triangle-based art every time.



If youâ€™re using Google Colab, the image will display automatically using:
from google.colab.patches import cv2\_imshow



\### How It Works



* A blank 800Ã—800 pixel canvas is created with NumPy.
* Random triangles are generated by picking three random points on the canvas.
* Each triangle is filled with a random color and alpha transparency (0.2â€“0.8).
* The triangles are blended using OpenCVâ€™s cv.addWeighted() for smooth layering.



\### Customize



You can easily tweak:



* canvas size â†’ to make larger or smaller art.
* alpha range â†’ for more or less transparency.
* Triangle count â†’ for denser or simpler designs.
