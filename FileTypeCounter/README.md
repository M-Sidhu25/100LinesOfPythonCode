# 🧮 File Type Counter

A simple, elegant Python tool that counts how many `.png`, `.txt`, and `.pdf` files exist in a given folder — including all its subfolders.

Built with **under 100 lines of code**, this script demonstrates:
- Clean, modular design
- Practical use of Python’s `pathlib`
- A small touch of polish — dynamic pluralization for better CLI output
