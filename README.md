# 🌟 Fork & Star ⭐ the Repository to Show Your Support!

Welcome to our project! We're excited to have you here. Below are some guidelines and information to help you contribute effectively.

---

## 🎉 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Code Requirements**
   - Your code must be under 100 lines.
   - It should be well-commented and easy to understand.
   - It should provide something interesting—this could be a unique algorithm, a cool use case or a clever trick in Python.
   - You can use modularization — meaning your project can have multiple small Python files working together, as long as each file individually follows the 100-line limit.

2. **File Structure**
   - Name your file using a descriptive title of what the code does.
   - Place your Python or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in a new folder.
   - Include a `README.md` file in your folder explaining your script.

3. **Submitting Your Work**
   - Submit a Pull Request 🔄 with your changes—whether it's fixing a bug or adding an exciting new feature.
   - Follow the [Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) 📜 to ensure that your PR aligns with our contribution standards.
   - Pull Request & Issue Linking when submitting a Pull Request (PR), please reference any related issue in your PR description using GitHub’s keywords "Closes #884" or "Fixes #884" in the comments.

4. **Get Started**
   - Don’t wait for an issue to be assigned to you. Start working on a snippet—even if there are duplicates, there will be good variations in the codes.
   - Feel free to submit your own issues or create a new one if you see a gap!
   - If you have any doubts feel free to use the discussions on github to ask the community about it.

**Important Note**: Do not use spaces in folder or file names; instead, use underscores (`___`) to separate words.
