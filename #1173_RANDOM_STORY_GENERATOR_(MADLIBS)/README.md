# Mad Libs Generator-
Enter funny or random answers to the prompts and watch a funny story unfold!

## But there are already two submissions, what's different here?
Others used AI to completely generate their code and README ;)

Also, this is different from many published on the internet as I use regex to avoid hardcoding things and make it elegant and optimal, keeping well under the 100 lines limit too :)

### Note
If empty string or whitespace is entered, the placeholder will become the value by default. To avoid this behaviour, one can use an invisible character not classified as whitespace ;)

## Modifications
One can easily change the stories by changing the MADLIBS list, and keep the placeholders in angle brackets.

Enjoy!
