# **Introduction to PulseWatch - Real time AIOps anamoly detection**
Modern IT systems generate massive volumes of operational data. Traditional monitoring tools can detect threshold breaches but struggle to understand *context* and *predict future failures*.  
**PulseWatch AIOps** solves this gap by applying artificial intelligence to operations â€” collecting metrics, detecting anomalies, and forecasting performance degradation before it impacts users.
