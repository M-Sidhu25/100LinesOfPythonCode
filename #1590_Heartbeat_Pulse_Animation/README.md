# Heartbeat Pulse Animation

This Python script creates a beautiful and rhythmic pulsing heart shape animation using `matplotlib` and `numpy`. The animation is generated by updating the plot in a loop, with a sine function creating the pulsing effect.

## How It Works

The script uses parametric equations to draw a heart shape, which is then scaled in a loop to create a beating effect. The `FuncAnimation` function from `matplotlib.animation` is used to create the animation, which is then displayed in a plot.

### Running the Script

To run the script, simply execute the Python file:

```bash
python heartbeat_animation.py
```

This will open a window with the heart pulse animation.
