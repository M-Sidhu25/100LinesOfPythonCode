\# Random Walk Art ðŸŽ¨



A fun Python script that generates unique abstract art using random shapes, colors, and positions with OpenCV.



\## What it does:



Each time you run the script, it randomly draws circles, rectangles, lines, and ellipses on a blank canvas; creating a new piece of colorful art every time!



\## How to run:



1\. Install dependencies:

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  pip install opencv-python numpy



2\. Run the script:

&nbsp;  python random\_walk\_art.py



-> If using Google Colab, the code already includes cv2\_imshow() for display.
