# Math Equation Solver Game

A fun and educational command-line game that challenges players to solve randomly generated math equations with varying difficulty levels.

## Description

Math Equation Solver Game is an interactive Python game that tests your mathematical skills across different difficulty levels. Players solve equations against the clock, earning points based on accuracy and speed. The game includes three difficulty modes with progressively challenging problems.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels:**
  - Easy: Addition and subtraction (numbers 1-10)
  - Medium: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication (numbers 1-20)
  - Hard: All four operations including division (larger numbers)

- **Time-Based Scoring:** Faster answers earn more points
- **5 Rounds per Game:** Each game session includes 5 equation rounds
- **Immediate Feedback:** Get instant results showing correctness, time taken, and points earned
- **Score Tracking:** Final score displayed at the end of each game

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses only standard library modules)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `math_equation_solver_game.py` file
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file

```bash
cd math_equation_solver_game
```

## Usage

Run the game using Python:

```bash
python math_equation_solver_game.py
```

### How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level (1-3) from the main menu
2. Solve 5 randomly generated math equations
3. Enter your answer for each equation
4. Try to answer as quickly as possible for maximum points
5. View your final score at the end of the game
6. Choose to play again or quit

### Scoring System

- Maximum 10 points per correct answer
- Points decrease based on time taken (minimum 1 point per correct answer)
- Incorrect answers award 0 points
- Maximum possible score: 50 points (10 points Ã— 5 rounds)
