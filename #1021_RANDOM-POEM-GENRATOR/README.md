# 🎭 Theme-Based Random Poem Generator

## Overview
**Theme-Based Poem Generator** is a Python script that fetches poems from the [PoetryDB API](https://poetrydb.org/) based on a user-provided theme or keyword.  
Simply type a word or concept (e.g., `love`, `rain`, `night`) and get a beautifully formatted poem in your terminal.
