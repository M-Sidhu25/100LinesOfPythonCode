# Galaxy Simulation

Hey! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple Python script that creates a cool spiral galaxy animation using matplotlib and numpy. Youâ€™ll see thousands of stars spinning around, kinda like what youâ€™d imagine a galaxy looks like from space.

## What does it do?

- Generates 3000 stars with random positions and colors
- Arranges them in spiral arms (like a real galaxy)
- Animates the stars so they rotate around the center
- Shows a bright yellow core in the middle

## How to run it

1. Make sure you have Python installed (I used Python 3.12, but anything recent should work).
2. Youâ€™ll need matplotlib and numpy. If you donâ€™t have them, just run this in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python galaxy.py
   ```

4. The animation window should pop up. If it doesnâ€™t, check your Python and matplotlib install.

## Why did I make this?

I just thought galaxies are awesome and wanted to see if I could make one with code. Itâ€™s also a fun way to mess around with numpy and matplotlib animations.

## Can I use this?

Yeah, go for it! Tweak the numbers, change the colors, make it your own. If you make something cooler, let me know ðŸ˜„
